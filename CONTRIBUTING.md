[![PRs Welcome][PRs-badge]][PRs-link]

We welcome and appreciate helpful contributions from the community. We do ask
that they are focused on the intended goal and unrelated changes are separated
into additional PRs.

### Align with maintainers first

We welcome conversation about your contribution ahead of opening your PR and
encourage aligning with project maintainers before investing significant effort
into your contribution.

Keep in mind that you are making a contribution to a project that is not your
own, so your first step is to convince the maintainers that your contribution
is one that they want to include in the project and maintain going forward.
Reaching concensus before you've made a significant investment in your
contribution will help the process go smoothly for everyone involved.

Opening an issue first is a great way to start the conversation about your
contribution idea. In addition, the maintainers can often be reached on the DSM
Web Collective Slack group. If you're not already a member, you can request an
invite at <http://dsmwebcollective.com>.

### Your first PR

If you are new to the process of making contributions through sending a
pull-request to a project, [this tutorial][PRs-link] can help get you started.
